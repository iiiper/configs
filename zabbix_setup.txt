// This document is meant to record what steps were taken to get Zabbix 3.0 running with a mysql backend 
// on Debian 8... I think

- Firstly, update everything, add the testing repos, update again
- The packages appear to have mostly taken care of themselves
- Find the index.html file and create a /zabbix in that directory, dump the frontend stuff there
- open a browser and go to <host>/zabbix
- should now be able to continue with using zabbix
