## This is the startup config for the rc shell, it's probably
## my favorite shell if a bit unweildy at first.

## In rc syntax, $* is equivalent to bash's $@
# a subshell is spawned by any command prefixed with '@'
# additonally, it's worth mentioning that rc has much more 
# C-like syntax than even csh.
# Important note: for a command like `make search key=darcs -C /usr/src`
# it needs to be rewritten as: `make search 'key=darcs' -C /usr/src`

## set some environmental variables 
LANG=(en_US.UTF-8)
TERM=(xterm-256color)
path=(/bin /sbin /usr/bin /usr/sbin /usr/local/bin /usr/local/sbin $home/bin $home/bin/c)

if (test -x `(which nvim)) {
	EDITOR=(nvim)
	VISUAL=(nvim)
} else {
	EDITOR=(vim)
	VISUAL=(vim)
}

## Define the $prompt
prompt=('
'$USER'@'`hostname':'`pwd'
; ' '')

## Function definitions
fn reload {
	# simply reload the file ~/.rcrc
	. $home/.rcrc
}

## Update the prompt to show the 
# directory as we chdir throughout the FS
fn cd {
	builtin cd $*
	&& reload
}

fn vim {
	$EDITOR $*
}

## get the weather forcast
fn weather {
	city=$*
	/usr/local/bin/curl wttr.in/$city
}

## useful shorthand for pkg_ng 
fn revdeps {
	/usr/sbin/pkg query %rn $*
}

fn deplist {
	/usr/sbin/pkg query %rn $*
}
