## This is the startup config for the rc shell, it's probably
## my favorite shell if a bit unweildy at first.

## In rc syntax, $* is equivalent to bash's $@
# a subshell is spawned by any command prefixed with '@'
# additonally, it's worth mentioning that rc has much more 
# C-like syntax than even csh.

## set some environmental variables 
LANG=(en_US.UTF-8)
TERM=(xterm-256color)
path=(/bin /sbin /usr/bin /usr/sbin /usr/local/bin /usr/local/sbin $home/bin $home/bin/c)

if (test -x `(which nvim)) {
	EDITOR=(nvim)
	VISUAL=(nvim)
} else {
	EDITOR=(vim)
	VISUAL=(vim)
}

## Define the $prompt
prompt=('
'`whoami'@'`hostname':'`pwd'
; ' '')

## Function definitions
fn reload {
	# simply reload the file ~/.rcrc
	. $home/.rcrc
}

## Update the prompt to show the 
# directory as we chdir throughout the FS
fn ncd {
	cd $*
	&& reload
}
